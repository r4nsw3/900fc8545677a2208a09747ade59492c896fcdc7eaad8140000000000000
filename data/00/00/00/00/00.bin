  |   Quick Balls are special Poké Balls that are more likely to catch      |
  |   Pokémon if you use them as soon as a battle begins.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Codes will be distributed between November 15, 2019 and January 15,   |
  |   2020, and expire on November 30, 2020.                                |

  |   Begin your adventure as a Pokémon Trainer by choosing one of three    |
  |   new partner Pokémon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble. Then embark on    |
  |   a journey in the new Galar region, where you'll challenge the         |
  |   troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the   |
  |   Legendary Pokémon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a      |
  |   vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the          |
  |   camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the     |
  |   new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles in which players will face     |
  |   off against gigantic and super-strong Pokémon known as Dynamax        |
  |   Pokémon.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Certain Pokémon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a          |
  |   powerful set of G-Max moves. But there's more to being a champion     |
  |   than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and     |
  |   get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be     |
  |   the Trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you'll           |
  |   encounter newly discovered Pokémon as well as familiar ones that      |
  |   will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! And for     |
  |   another way to level up your Pokémon, assign them Poké Jobs to        |
  |   complete. You can even play with your Pokémon in Pokémon Camp, just   |
  |   for fun!                                                              |
